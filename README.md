An IoT architectâ€™s job is to help you clients Automate, Monitor, save time, save money, collect
information to make quality decisions.
In Most cases it is about generating data from your end device and sending it over to cloud to either
visualize or analyse.

OUR PROBLEM STATTEMENT: 
Handling street lights manually via individual switches for each of the street light is a waste of time and energy. Automated lights, that is, smart lighting is the need in order to save energy as well as time.

WORKING PRINCIPLE: 
An IoT based solution that will keep track of which lights are working, and how much electricity they are consuming will work the best in such a scenario. The solution should have either phase wise control or individual light wise control. A single gateway device that can upload this data to the Internet, and operate the lights at the same time, will help the supervisors immensely. A connection backbone of wireless technologies like Wi-Fi will be the most cost-effective solution. Automated ON / OFF control of individual lights will be possible at the end of the completion of the project.

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. Heroku has been one of the important part of the project rendering a cloud platform for exchange of data from the internet to the microcontroller and vice versa.

Maintains a PostgreSQL database of all the streetlights
in the network
Hosts the web application so its online 24/7
Collects and analyzes data from all the nodes to get
insights

A user-friendly and attractive Web-application is developed for the user. It allows real time control of streetlights
